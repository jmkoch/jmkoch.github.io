## Welcome!

My name is Jordan Koch, and I am a computational biologist, working in Dr. Emma Goldberg's lab in the Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior Department at the University of Minnesota. 
I am a co-developer of the RevBayes software, working to improve its usability and help documentation. I am also building a web-based data management system (using Django) to store and organize plant data from scientific literature.

This webpage serves as a host to my professional developments and aspirations. Please feel free to email at jkoch<at>umn<dot>edu with any questions, ideas, or opportunities! Thanks for visiting.
